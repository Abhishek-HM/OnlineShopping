## Introduction
Greetings from the Kaggle bot! This is an automatically-generated kernel with starter code demonstrating how to read in the data and begin exploring. If you're inspired to dig deeper, click the blue "Fork Notebook" button at the top of this kernel to begin editing.

## Exploratory Analysis
To begin this exploratory analysis, first import libraries and define functions for plotting the data using matplotlib. Depending on the data, not all plots will be made.<br/> (Hey, I'm just a simple kerneling bot, not a Kaggle Competitions Grandmaster!)z
